- **Jupyter Notebooks**

## Project Structure 🗂️

1. **Data Collection**: Utilize the 1990 California census data for the analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and preprocess the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
   - Summarize the main characteristics of the data.
   - Identify trends, patterns, and correlations in the housing features.
   - Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Create new features to enhance the model's predictive power.
   - Normalize and standardize the data as needed.
5. **Model Building**: 
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Develop a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
   - Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
   - Fine-tune the model to improve its predictive accuracy.
7. **Visualization**: 
   - Generate visualizations to interpret the model's predictions.
   - Compare actual vs. predicted house values.
